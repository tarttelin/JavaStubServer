/**
 * Stub server is intended to give a mockito-esque feel to a stubbed HTTP server.  This allows you to test
 * an application that hits external HTTP interfaces as a proper black box.  Take this example
 * <p>
 * You have a web application that hits a ReST api to retrieve customer information.  In the web app code, you have
 * a gateway that calls the ReST api using a real HTTP request.  In a test environment, you don't want to, or cannot
 * depend on the real ReST api, so you want to have a fake server that provides canned data back.  This is what
 * StubServer is intended to simplify for you.
 * <p>
 * Example test:<br>
 *   Deploy your web app with a config file that declares that the ReST api is accessible on http://localhost:21435</li>
 *   <pre>
 *   StubServer server = new StubServer(21435); // matching port
 *   server.start();
 *   server.expect(get("/api/customer/Bob")).thenReturn(200, "application/xml","&lt;customer>&lt;name>Bob&lt;/name>&lt;/customer>");
 *   // can have multiple expectations. The url is actually a regex
 *   try {
 *      selenium.open("http://localhost:8080/users/?name=Bob");
 *      ... assertions that Bob has the right values as returned from the external ReST api
 *
 *      server.verify(); // check that all expectations were called
 *   } finally {
 *      server.close();
 *   }
 *   </pre>
 * <p>
 * With this approach, it feels more like a unit test, but it allows you to totally black box the system under test.
